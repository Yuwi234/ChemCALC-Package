# Chemical Engineering Tools

Chemical Engineering Tools is a Python package designed to assist chemical engineers with various calculations, including mass balance, energy balance, and stoichiometry.

## Features

- **Mass Balance Solver**: Compute mass balances for chemical processes.
- **Energy Balance Calculator**: Perform energy balance calculations to determine energy requirements or outputs.
- **Stoichiometry Assistant**: Aid in stoichiometric calculations for chemical reactions.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install chemical_engineering_tools
```

## Usage

Here's how you can use the package in your projects:

```python
from chemical_engineering_tools import MassBalanceSolver, EnergyBalanceCalculator, StoichiometryAssistant

# Initialize the solvers
mass_solver = MassBalanceSolver()
energy_calculator = EnergyBalanceCalculator()
stoich_assistant = StoichiometryAssistant()

# Example usage
# mass_solver.solve(...)
# energy_calculator.calculate(...)
# stoich_assistant.assist(...)
```

Replace the placeholder methods with actual method calls as per your package's functionality.
